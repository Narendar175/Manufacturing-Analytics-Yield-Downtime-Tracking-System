<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1:Manufacturing Analytics Yield & Downtime Tracking System </h3>
<p>
  The dashboard will be organized into distinct analytical views, each tailored to answer specific business questions and equipped with advanced interactive features.
Primary Analytical Views:
    
1.Yield Analysis: A dedicated view for tracking production output against established targets. This section will feature key visualizations for monitoring cumulative output loss trends, enhanced with 7-day and 30-day moving averages to smooth daily fluctuations and reveal underlying performance patterns.

2.Downtime Analysis: An interactive view to analyze downtime hours, calculate the associated financial costs, and identify recurring patterns by machine and production line. This directly supports our objective to quantify the financial impact of production stoppages.

3.Defect Driver Analysis: A deep-dive section designed to isolate the top causes of production defects. It will feature matrix visualizations with conditional formatting to automatically highlight problem areas, enabling users to analyze defect patterns by shift and machine. This view is central to achieving our objective to identify the root causes of performance issues.
